# jira-copilot-playground
Repo to test JIRA copilot integrations
# Jira + Copilot Playground

This repository is used to experiment with:
- Jira user stories
- GitHub issue automation
- AI-generated code via GitHub Copilot

## Conventions
- One Jira story = one GitHub issue
- Code should be simple and readable
- Prefer standard library only
